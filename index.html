<p>Welcome to this little corner of the Internet.  My name is Patrick Burden and I am going to be honest with you, when it comes to making a personal website I am better at actually making it happen than to actually write about myself.  That is not due to nothing having anything to say (see the personal blog for more about that) its more about how I grew up.  My Dad instilled a work ethic in me where as long as I did the best I could and try to better myself each step of the way the results will happen to you when they happen.</p>

<p>So when talking about myself I tend to let the major milestones come in four acts.   Unlike most stories they tend to overlap one another and there appears to be more coming down the line but for the sake of an about page on a website that is going to be seen by people who have my business card or on some random Google search, it works out just fine. </p>

<p>First is my IT career, I started back in high school at a vocational school where I was learning about computer networking, got my CNA (Certified Novell Administrator) in Novell 5.1 and 6.x and my MCSE (Microsoft Certified System Engineer) in Windows 2000 while helping the IT staff keeping the school afloat.  From there I moved on to college, had jobs ranging from call center lead to shift manager and eventually ended up as a QA analyst for a software company.  Along the way, I learned the art of dealing with people who were upset with their computers, talking to them to find out what their issues were, and working with them to find a solution to whatever problem that they would have. </p>

<p>Next, I have my volunteer side of me, where I fell in love with conventions.  It was a magical place to share ideas, make new friends, play games together, and be yourself.  In order to attend these events (while saving money to be able to go to them) I got into public speaking.  I researched topics, created a presentation about it, and then presented it at the event.  The audience was generally happy with what was there and I was invited back to continue to do this, meanwhile some places wanted me to be a bit more involved. </p>

<p>So I did what most people who was eager to help do, I became a staff member.  With my predication towards the speaking, I eventually became a manager of programming for several different conventions.  What tends to be looked upon as something that spans a weekend turned into something that lasted throughout the year.  From the onboarding process of locating speakers, to the documentation management of training manuals, to the managing of a team of volunteers during the event, to the overall organization of the event itself.  Each year was a stepping-stone in identifying what went well and what could be better, once you find that out you start the process again. </p>

<p>You might be thinking now, what is next?  During covid I took a good year figuring that out and found my new calling in becoming a librarian.  It may seem like a leap but actually, it makes sense.  First to see if I was able to handle the digital aspects of collection I created a website where I am going through and archiving footage from other fan conventions (right now I am going through the PAX catalogue, eleven years down seven to go).  In doing so, I had to teach myself a little video editing to stitch clips together using a program called Davinci Resolve. </p>

<p>From there my research skills kicked in as I wanted to make sure everyone know what on stage (even if they were not credited by the event itself) got proper credit with their credentials and using the power of WordPress being able to search for things in an ok manner.  Would I redo this using other technologies now?  Yes absolutely, however you cannot know what you need until you get something unless you try to make it an actual thing as opposed to an idea. </p>

<p>So why did I write all this out for you?  Well for the first time in my life, I am going to do a major career pivot and having a personal website on a resume and business card is a good way to show them that
<ul>
<li>You actually exist </li>
<li>You know something about HTML 5 and CSS that you can do in your new position </li>
<li>Usually separates you from other candidates that just put their LinkedIn profile (no shame in that I used to be that way too) </li>
<li>Be able to talk in a more longer form that other pieces of documentation </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>That is about it for now, I am currently taking classes to get an MLIS and I look to the future a bit nervous and excited to see where I am going to go.  Thanks for taking the time to read all this by the way, I know most people would have skimmed the first paragraph and moved on from there. Hope you have a great day.</p>
